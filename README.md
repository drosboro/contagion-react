# Usage

To see a demo of Contagion in action, visit http://contagion.rosborough.ca/

In the current version, the Settings form is populated with somewhat reasonable default values.  Changing the settings will change the parameters on which the simulation operates.  To run the simulation, simply click on the "Run" button.

At this point, that's pretty much all there is to it!
